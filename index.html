    <h1>PIG DICE</h1>
    <p>This is a simple <strong>dice game</strong> played with many rule variations. Pig dice is whatâ€™s known as a jeopardy game. You will have to make risky choice to balance getting ahead without losing it all.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO PLAY PIG DICE</h3>
    <p>The objective of the game is to score 100 points before your opponent does. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>Play is taken in turns. On each person's turn that person has the option of either:
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Rolling the dice:</strong> where a roll of two to six is added to their score for that turn and the player's turn continues as the player is given the same choice again; or a roll of 1 loses the player's total points for that turn and
            their turn finishes with play passing to the next player.</li>
          <li><strong>Holding:</strong> the player's score for that round is added to their total and becomes safe from the effects of throwing a 1 (one). The player's turn finishes with play passing to the next player.</li>
