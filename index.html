        <h1>PIG DICE</h1>
        <img src="images/logo.jpeg">
        <p>This is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29">dice game</a> played with many rule variations. Pig dice is whatâ€™s known as a jeopardy game. You will have to make risky choice to balance getting ahead without losing
          it all.</p>

        <h3>HOW TO PLAY PIG DICE</h3>
        <p>The objective of the game is to score 100 points before your opponent does. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
          <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
          <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
          <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
        </ul>
