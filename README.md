# Pig Dice

This is a program of a simple dice game where in each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". The first to reach 100 points wins the game.


## Specifications
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to exercise my JavaScript programming skills with constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, methods, jQuery and DOM manipulation and traversal.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This game can be played on any web browser available on your device.

## Known Bugs
There are no unresolved issues in regards to this code that I know of.

## Prerequisites
To be able to run this game, you will need to have a web browser, preferably Google Chrome. Just open the url link deployed on GitHub and run it.

## Technologies Used
I worked on this code on Linux OS. I used HTML to write the code, CSS and Bootstrap to style and organize it; JavaScript and the jQuery-3.3.1.min library for functionality purposes, and Markdown language on the ABOUTME section. I created the code using Atom and Git applications.

## Support and contact details
If there are any issues on how the code runs, concerns, questions or ideas, kindly reach out to me on my email address; nanciekathini@gmail.com.
